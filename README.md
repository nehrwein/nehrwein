### Hi there 👋

I am Birgit :smiley_cat:, a passionate frontend developer with lots of experience managing IT-projects on the client side. I love to code in Javascript and React and I have a big fullstack ambition! :construction_worker:

Right now I am in the middle of the [Technigo bootcamp](https://www.technigo.io/). A 24-week fast-paced remote bootcamp :muscle: focused on 🛠️
- JavaScript (ES6) 
- React 
- Redux
- HTML5
- CSS 
- Node.js 

I do weekly projects covering everything from the basics of programming to structuring web projects in the latest technologies.
